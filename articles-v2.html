                        <h2>Questions to Ask Your Insurance Agent</h2>
                        <p class="date">Fri, May 12, 2018</p>
                        <p class="author"><img src="images/customer-photo.jpg" alt="img"> <span>By Heena Bathla</span> Editor at Quickbima <a href="" class="twitter-usr">@bathla_heena</a></p>
                        
                        <img src="images/article_910_Businessman-drawing-Insurance-concept.jpg" class="post-img" alt="img">
                        
                        <p>As a child, you may have been a witness to meetings in your living room sofa, where someone was trying to sell something to your father. We never knew what they talked about, but the meeting seemed to go on for quite a few hours, and your father often asked many questions which were met with enthusiastic answers. Your father may have tried to politely end it with, 'Thank you, I'll be in touch,' but the other person always persisted.</p>
                        <p>Today, you may find yourself in a similar situation and understand how financial advisors strive to sell insurance. Financial protection is a must for your family. That begs the question: if you ever wish to purchase insurance, what would you ask your financial advisor?</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. What type of insurance should I purchase? </h4>
                        <p>It is crucial to first identify your needs and define your goals before making any buying decision. This will ensure that you are able to present your needs to the agent, so that he is well equipped to recommend the best suited product – be it an endowment plan, a term plan or a ULIP.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>2. What is the product?</h4>
                        <p>Once the advisor makes a recommendation, ensure you are aware of every last detail of the product. Trust only goes so far. Learn and understand what are the merits and demerits of the policy, total duration of the plan, maturity benefits and most importantly how much money is involved. As you have to pay a regular premium for your policy, it is vital that you determine beforehand if you will be able to afford the premium payments.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>3. How will my family get the money?</h4>
                        <p>our primary purpose of taking a life insurance plan is to provide your family with a financially secure future. You must ask your insurance advisor the process by which you can add beneficiaries to the insurance plan. What will happen if you survive the insurance period? Do you get returns on your investment? What will happen if there is more than one nominee in the plan? Without any nominee, who will get the insurance amount? Answering each of these questions is important so that you buy the policy completely aware and are sure of what to expect.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>4. Can I save tax?</h4>
                        <p>Ask your insurance advisor about the tax benefits of the product recommended. The insurance product should allow you tax benefits under section 80C and 10(10D), and if you're eligible for tax rebates under special conditions, your insurance advisor will let you know.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>5. What is the process?</h4>
                        <p>When compared to offline plans, online insurance plans are cheaper and quicker to buy. You should ask your insurance advisor about the process of buying the plan online and the formalities you have to fulfil. Ask about the documents needed and the time usually needed to conclude the formalities. The insurer may reject your application if your claim amount is disproportionate to your income, or on the basis of your poor health.</p>
                        <p>However, to reiterate, it is crucial that you are aware of your needs and goals before initiating a conversation with an insurer or agent. This will ensure that you are buying the right product and not sinking your money in a bad investment.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>You must be the priority</h4>
                        <p> Insurers are coming up with new and innovative customer-centric approaches that help customers to determine their objectives. For instance, Edelweiss Tokio Life’s Vijaypath. This initiative helps customers have a smooth financial planning experience by first identifying their financial need and assessing their risk appetite, before deciding on buying a product. It is good to see such processes which are focussed on what you want and prioritise your requirements over blind selling. Vijaypath, for example, looks at your life stage and goals, and may then suggest whether retirement planning is more important to you than living with impaired health.</p>
                        <p>You may also check out insurance aggregators to choose the perfect product for yourself. As life is uncertain, it is time that you take responsibility for yourself and your loved one's future. Consult an insurance advisor, ask these questions and buy an ideal insurance plan as soon as possible.</p>

                        <h2>Online Insurance Vs Offline Insurance Policy - Which Is Better &amp; Why</h2>
                        <p class="date">Fri, May 12, 2018</p>
                        <p class="author"><img src="images/customer-photo.jpg" alt="img"> <span>By Heena Bathla</span> Editor at Quickbima <a href="" class="twitter-usr">@bathla_heena</a></p>
                        
                        <img src="images/health-article.jpg" class="post-img" alt="img">
                        
                        <p>People have grown to be increasingly dependent on technology over the past couple of years. Buying clothes, furniture, flight tickets etc. can be done in the click of a button. To take advantage of the benefits of ecommerce, the insurance sector has stepped up its game by offering services online. Almost every insurance company has launched their online products in the market. However, the whole concept of buying insurance online is relatively a new in the Indian market. Many have missed out on its benefits due to lack of awareness. </p>
                        <p>Now if you are planning to avail an insurance policy you can do so through two channels - online mode or offline. To help you take the right decision, we have weighed the benefits of buying insurance online versus buying it offline.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cost</h4>
                        <p>You will find that it costs more to buy insurance through the offline mode. The reason behind this is that offline plans are purchased through agents. Involving middlemen will bring up the insurance company’s operational costs. To make up for the increased expense, insurance companies will charge policyholders higher premiums. In the case of online channel, the insurance company saves on infrastructure and distribution costs and these benefits get passed down to the insurance buyers in the form of lower premiums. At QuickBima, you can get up to 40% off on various insurance plans.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>Flexibility</h4>
                        <p> Online channels offer more flexibility when it comes to buying insurance plans as compared to offline channels. You can sit in the comfort of your home, compare the different policies and select one that meets all your needs. However, it is important that you read through all the facts and information and accordingly take a decision. The plus point of buying insurance online is that you are more aware of the product you are purchasing. In case of offline channel, the agent will do all your paperwork. While you may consider this a boon, there have been cases where agents have mis-sold policies and cost policyholders more than what was required.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
                        
                        <h4>Brand vs Person</h4>
                        <p>When you buy insurance online, you are directly dealing with the brand, which is the insurance company. You can take your time to weigh the pros and cons and then decide which course of action to take. On the other hand, when you buy a plan in offline mode, you would be doing it through an agent. The agent may have a certain target to meet with regards to sales and so may pressurize you to make the policy purchase at the earliest. There is more value in buying a policy directly from the company than through an insurance agent.</p>
                        
                        <hr>
