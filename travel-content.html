                        <h3>What to Consider before selecting a Travel Insurance Plan</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Costs will have their own significance when you select travel insurance plan. It is better to go with minimum premiums that are convenient and easily fit your budget to make your insurance cheap and affordable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Credibility of the Company:</strong> It is very important to build trust with the company who is going to be your insurance provider. You will have the faith that the company will deliver all the promises in time. </li>
                            <li><strong>Destination:</strong> The premium required to be paid will depend on your destination greatly. The premium coverage will be higher in places where health care services are expensive. </li>
                            <li><strong>Hassle-free:</strong> Convenience should be your first priority while selecting an insurance plan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose of the Trip:</strong> If you trip involves a lot of adventure sports, it is better to opt for a special plan that provides adequate coverage. In the case, your trip is a more relaxing one; you can go with the basic insurance plan. </li>
                            <li><strong>Duration of the Trip:</strong> If your trip is of a longer duration, your premium will be higher, and vice versa. For frequent fryers, choosing an annual multi-trip plan will be an economic option. </li>
                            <li><strong>Sum Insured:</strong> The premium will greatly depend on the sum insured. The policy cost will be higher if the insured sum is high. </li>
                            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Premiums differ depending on the age of the person. The plan for a 45 years old person would vary from a 25 years old individual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Having add-ons in your plan will have an effect on your premium. Add-ons help you widen the bracket of the coverage plan. </li>
                            <li><strong>Claim Settlement Percentage:</strong> The number of claims the insurance company has settles gives the company an edge as compared to other companies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Solvency Ratio:</strong> The solvency ratio is important for understanding the goodwill and steadiness of the insurance company. It shows the ability of the company to deliver its promises without being bankrupt.</li>
                        </ul>
